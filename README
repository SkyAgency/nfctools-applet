== NFC Tools Java Applet ==

This project contains the source code for the NFC Tools Java Applet.

This applet is used to establish communication to a NFC desktop reader. 
It is used in the Android Beam Demo at http://grundid.de/nfc and the NDEF Editor http://ndefeditor.com

Please note that I do not endorse the use of Java Applets in new projects. 
Many users might have Java disabled in their browsers. Iâ€™m sharing this source only for demo purposes.
