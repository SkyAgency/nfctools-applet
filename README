== NFC Tools Java Applet ==

This project contains the source code for the NFC Tools Java Applet.

This applet is used to establish communication to a NFC desktop reader. 
It is used in the Android Beam Demo at http://grundid.de/nfc and the NDEF Editor http://ndefeditor.com

To build a version of this applet you will need a (self-signed) certificate. 
Please check the web how to create certificates for Java applets.

Once you have a certificate create a profile entry in your maven settings.xml file like this or update the pom.xml directly:

<profile>
  <id>ndef-applet-release</id>
  <properties>
	<sign.keystore>ndef-applet.keystore</sign.keystore>
	<sign.alias>your-alias</sign.alias>
	<sign.storepass>your-storepass</sign.storepass>
	<sign.keypass>your-keypass</sign.keypass>
  </properties>
</profile>

Then to compile the applet call

mvn -P release,ndef-applet-release package

nfctools-applet-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies-small.jar will be your signed applet jar.


Please note that I do not endorse the use of Java Applets in new projects. 
Many users might have Java disabled in their browsers. Iâ€™m sharing this source only for demo purposes.
